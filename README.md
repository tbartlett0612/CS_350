<h1> CS_350 Portfolio - UART</h1>
<h2><b>Summarize the project and what problem it was solving</b></h2>
The purpose of this project was to create a prototype of a smart thermostat using the TI board. For the prototype, it used the TMP006 temperature sensor to read the room temperature (via I2C), an LED to indicate the output to the thermostat where LED on = heat on (via GPIO), two buttons to increase and decrease the set temperature (via GPIO interrupt), and the UART to simulate the data being sent to the server.

<h2><b>What did you do particularly well</b></h2>
I feel I was able to create a well designed task scheduler that helped make laying out and designing the code a lot easier. With creating the logic in the diagram, I was able to come up with the IF/ELSE statements that corresponded to these tasks.
